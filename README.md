# SkyRoute

## About:

I created this project as part of my Codecademy's curriculum. 

"SkyRoute" is a tool that uses depth first-search and breadth-first search in order to determine the fastest route from one landmark to another in Vancouver.

For the purposes of this project, I assume that it takes the same amount of time to get from each station to each of its connected neighboring stations.
